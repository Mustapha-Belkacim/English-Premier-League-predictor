This is the code for "Predicting the Winning Team with Machine Learning" by Siraj Raval on Youtube


## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/6tQhoUuQrOw) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval. We're going to predict whether or not the home team will win given a set of other statistics. The dataset for this was retrieved from [this](http://football-data.co.uk/data.php) site. 

## Dependencies

* scikit-learn 
* xgboost
* pandas

Install missing dependencies with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). 

## Usage

Run `jupyter notebook` in terminal, then the code will pop up in your browser.

Install jupyter [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
