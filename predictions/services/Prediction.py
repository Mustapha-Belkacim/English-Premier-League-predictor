# ## Steps
# 
# 1. We will clean our dataset
# 2. Split it into training and testing data (12 features & 1 target (winning team (Home/Away/Draw))
# 3. Train 3 different classifiers on the data 
#   -Logistic Regression
#   -Support Vector Machine 
#   -XGBoost
# 4. Use the best Classifer to predict who will win given an away team and a home team
#
# ## Dataset
# - Retrived dataset from http://football-data.co.uk/data.php
# or go under static/data/

# F1 score (also F-score or F-measure) is a measure of a test's accuracy. 
#It considers both the precision p and the recall r of the test to compute 
#the score: p is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of 
#all positive results, and r is the number of correct positive results divided by 
#the number of positive results that should have been returned. The F1 score can be 
#interpreted as a weighted average of the precision and recall, where an F1 score 
#reaches its best value at 1 and worst at 0.
